For the scenario given, I assumed the entities to be the customer, item, order, and finalized order. I assumed that finalized order would be an entity because it would be unable to change once it was finalized. The Vertabello Schema seemed to be a little more difficult than the Lucid Chart ER diagram. It was hard for me to determine when to use Primary Keys instead of Foriegn Keys, but I think that I ended up with a pretty well made graph. My graphs were:  
My LucidChart Graph:![LucidChart]({{"/assets/Images/Grocery Store ER Diagram.png" | relative_url}})  
My Vertabella Schema: ![Vertabello]({{"/assets/Images/Data_Modeling_Lab-2023-09-22_15-04.png" | relative_url}})  
All in all, I think my graphs are at least mostly correct, but I am not fully sure if the Vertabello Schema is normalized. I can not think of any complications that might arise becuase of the models.
