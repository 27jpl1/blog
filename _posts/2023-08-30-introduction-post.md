When setting up this blog, everything I had to do was new to me. I knew that the terminal could be used, but I had no idea how. Since I knew nothing about how to use the terminal, it gave me most of my troubles. It was extremely stressful to continue to try to change things inside the terminal to make the ruby work. Although took a lot of time and effort, it was rewarding to finally have everything work and have a blog site pull up. Luckily I had found a couple of websites that helped me update my computers pre-existing Ruby and add the extra stuff I needed.
The websites I used helped me:  
    1. [Install openssl](https://www.atpeaz.com/fix-ruby-gem-install-openssl-ssl-h-error/)  
    2. [Installing, Unistalling, and Updating Ruby](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/1.html)  
    3. [Installing Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  
Two parts still do not make sense to me:  
    1. I still do not know what Homebrew does or why it is needed for downloading Jekyll and Ruby.   
    2. Jekyll does not make much sense to me. My understanding of Jekyll is that it is the repository that was forked to start the process of creating this blog.  
Even with all the confusion, I am still excited to learn more about creating this blog, styling, and all the Projects/Labs that are remaining. Hopefully, I won't encounter as many problems as I did with this Lab.
