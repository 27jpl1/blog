The easiest parts of the tutorial was making my own Razor Pages Application. The first time through the tutorial it was difficult because I had no prior experience and it was hard to tell what everything did, but once I had made it through I was able to connect everything together to understand it more clearly. The most confusing part of the tutorial is the database backend of the Razor Pages. Since it do not show much of how to use it, I am still confused on how to access or to use SQLite to work with a database for a Razor Page. When creating my own Razor Page, I found the hardest part was figuring out what names to use in commands to makes sure I was doing the correct operations on the right files. There seems to be a lot of parallels betwenn Razor Pages and the Jekyll blog. Both have a lot of pieces that work together to create the application. I would feel extremely confident making another Razor Pages similar to these.
