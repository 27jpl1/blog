The easiest parts of the tutorial were the first couple of steps before the model bacema more complex. It was simple to understand what was happening when there were only students. It became more ocnfusing once courses,intsructors, and deparements were introduced. It was hard to tell what was going on or what did what once the model become more complex. It was harder to work with multiple tables because it was difficult to tell how the Razor Pages worked with primary and foreign keys. It was also hard to tell what many of the functions we were adding or changing did, or how to change them for our own projects. I feel a little better about our ability to help our client. Luckily we do not have to do much more than a functioning database, but comparing years looks like it could be extremly difficult to implement.
