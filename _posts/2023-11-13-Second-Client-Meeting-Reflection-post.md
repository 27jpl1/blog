My continued role in the team project has evolved from client communication to and SQL Schema Deisgn to include Team Organization plus a little framework development. For the moqups and demos, I have created most of them. I created and have updated the moqups all throughout the project development. For the demo, I created the scaffolding and changed the CRUD pages for the booths, startup, income, and expenses to work how we wanted. My future plans to assist my team in completing this project is to take a backseat and work on little changes or features and to let the others work on the major implementations left.
