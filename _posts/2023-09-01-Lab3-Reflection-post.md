Lab 3 originally went a lot smoother than Lab 2 did. The first step was simple. The second gave me a little trouble trying to figure out how to get the CSCI 340 Homepage into the nav bar. Step three gave me some trouble, but I was able to work around and make everything look well enough. While working on step three there were times when I would feel like nothing was working, so I would look like: ![Stress1]({{"/assets/Images/download-2.jpg" | relative_url}})  
I was not able to change all that I wanted to, but I am content with how my blog looks. Step 4 looked to be pretty easy, but ended up being the most difficult step. Adding images to posts was very difficult. I went to many websites like:  
    1. [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40197197/jekyll-how-to-display-an-image-in-a-post)  
    2. [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images)  
These websites helped me see what I needed to do, but when I did it, it did not work. So I felt like: ![Stress2]({{"/assets/Images/Stressed-Out.jpg" | relative_url}})  
Finally, I got the pictures to work by moving my images folder to the assests folder. For this lab, having to search through the different html files to find classes to try to change using css was completely new to me, and I still was unable to find the correct classes to change the header's text to be white. I struggled a lot with trying to incorporate the images into this post, and I still do not know why the images need to be in the assets folder to work. I am looking forward to working more with html and css, so I understand how things go together better, so I do not have to be stressed testing things out.
