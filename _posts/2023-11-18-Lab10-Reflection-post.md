The easiest part of the tutorial probably was the first step, but it still was a little difficult because we did not have experience with the layout of Azure. I think almost every other step had at least one problem or part that was confusing. It seemed like something was missing or some context was not given. Our team divided up the work by working on parts in class when possible, otherwise Caden did most of the work because it was all on his computer. I think it helped build our communication skills because Caden came into class with issues that we either helped fix or got help for. The link for the project is msdocs-core-sql-lax.azurewebsites.net.
