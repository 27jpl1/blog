By working with our community partner, the finance comittee for the St. Joseph Bazaar, in the Database and Web Systems class, I significantly improved my communication, teamwork, and time management skills. While all these skills are important and valuable in carrying out the social change work with our community parnter, communcication is the most important because it not only enhances overall productivity but also enables addressing key areas that require attention.  I find our community partner's approaches to be effective means of instigating change, given that the funds raised from the bazaar contribute to a worthy cause. By assisting them in streamlining their financial tracking processes, they will be able to redirect their focus to more urgent matters.  The coursework and project work in the class have been instrumental in broadening my perspective on the many diverse ways to contribute to positive change in the world. Additionally, this experience has bolstered my confidence in navigating a church setting, as I've gained valuable insights into the behind-the-scenes and financial aspects through our community partner's role.
