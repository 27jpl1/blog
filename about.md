My name is JP Lyon, and I am a current student at Hendrix College. This Website has been created for my Database and Web Systems class. By the end of the class, I will written many blogs posts concerning the numerous Projects and Labs I will have completed throughout the class. Some interesting things about me are that I am left-handed, I hope to double major in Computer Science and Religious Studies, I play Ultimate Frisbee, and I am a co-captain of the Rocket League team.
